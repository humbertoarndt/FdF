# What is project about?
Creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape.
This will be my first time using the school graphical library MiniLibX. What is that?


# VNC
Since the project requires an interface I discovered that I need to use a VNC in order to make it works. So what is a VNC?

VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is a cross-platform screen sharing system that was created to remotely control another computer using Remote Frame Buffer protocol. It transmits the keyboard and mouse input from one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates, over network.
